# üß† A Sentiment-Aware Transformer Framework for EEG-Based Emotion and Cognitive Load Analysis

This repository implements a novel **Sentiment-Aware Transformer Network (SATN)** designed to analyze emotional states and cognitive load using EEG signals. It introduces an advanced modeling framework that fuses deep learning with domain-specific sentiment information, enabling high-resolution, real-time tracking of mental states ‚Äî particularly applicable in competitive and high-pressure environments such as sports.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/eeg-sentiment-transformer.git
cd eeg-sentiment-transformer
```

2. **Create environment and install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Optional: Use `conda` or `virtualenv` if preferred.

## üì• Dataset

This framework assumes preprocessed EEG data saved in `.npy` format.

You can preprocess public EEG datasets (e.g., DEAP, SEED) using the script:

```bash
python scripts/preprocess.py
```

- Raw `.edf` EEG files should be stored in `data/raw/`
- Preprocessed features will be saved to `data/processed/`

---

## üèóÔ∏è Model Overview

- **Input**: Extracted EEG feature vectors (e.g., statistical signals per channel)
- **Transformer Encoder**: Captures temporal and spatial dependencies
- **Sentiment Embedding**: Each token is weighted based on domain-specific sentiment scores
- **EDO**: Emotion-Driven Optimization applies weighted losses using sentiment signals
- **Output**: Emotion or cognitive load classification label

---

## üöÄ Quickstart

### Train the model

```bash
python scripts/train.py
```

Trained models will be saved in `checkpoints/`.

### Evaluate the model

```bash
python scripts/evaluate.py
```

### Inference on new data

```bash
python scripts/inference.py
```

Ensure `sample.npy` is a processed EEG feature file.

---

## üîß Configuration

You can adjust model/training settings via `config/config.yaml`.

Example:

```yaml
training:
  epochs: 20
  learning_rate: 0.0005
  use_edo: true
model:
  num_heads: 8
  hidden_dim: 512
```

## üìä Metrics & Evaluation

We report:

- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Per-class evaluation (via `classification_report`)
- Support for ablation and baseline comparison under `experiments/`

---

## üß™ Example Experiments

- `experiments/baseline_comparison/`: Compare SATN with CNN/LSTM
- `experiments/ablation_study/`: Disable EDO or lexicon embeddings

---

## üîÆ Future Development

We envision several meaningful extensions and enhancements to this framework to improve its performance, generalization, and real-world applicability:

### 1. Real-time EEG Stream Processing
- Integration with real-time EEG acquisition systems (e.g., OpenBCI, Emotiv) to support live emotion and cognitive monitoring in sports, e-learning, or VR/AR applications.
- Develop asynchronous input pipelines and latency-aware model adaptations.

### 2. Cross-Domain Transfer Learning
- Implement domain adaptation techniques to transfer learned EEG emotion representations from general datasets (e.g., DEAP, SEED) to domain-specific data such as sports, gaming, or military simulations.
- Evaluate few-shot learning and unsupervised pretraining to reduce data dependence.

### 3. Multimodal Fusion
- Combine EEG signals with other physiological or behavioral modalities (e.g., facial expressions, speech, heart rate variability, eye-tracking) for richer affective computing.
- Design transformer-based cross-modal encoders or fusion heads.

### 4. Neurofeedback & Closed-Loop Interfaces
- Incorporate neurofeedback mechanisms for mental resilience training (e.g., alert athletes to cognitive overload or frustration).
- Develop reward-based adaptive feedback using reinforcement learning.

### 5. Explainability and Interpretability
- Use attention visualization, SHAP or LIME to better understand the neural correlates of emotion.
- Design interpretable modules for coaches or sports psychologists to explore mental patterns.

### 6. Deployable Toolkits & APIs
- Wrap the framework into a RESTful API or lightweight mobile/edge application using ONNX or TensorFlow Lite.
- Create customizable dashboards for teams, coaches, or researchers to monitor player states.
